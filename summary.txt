In this simulation, we modeled a grocery store with randomly arriving customers and several checkout checkers.
 Customers had a random number of items and took a proportionate amount of time to shop. The checkout time was based on how many items the customer had.

From the simulation, I learned that increasing the number of checkers significantly reduces the average wait time for customers.
 However, having too many checkers increases the overall idle time, meaning some checkers spend a lot of time doing nothing.

By changing the number of checkers and adjusting the customer arrival rates, I observed how staffing decisions impact customer service and employee productivity.
 I also added extra analysis like average number of items purchased and maximum wait time to get a better understanding of customer experience.

This project helped me learn how to set up a basic event-driven simulation using SimPy.
